    <h3>Who am I?</h4>
    <p>
      <small>Hey, I'm Ümit Mete, I usually go by Mete.
        <i>(Pronounced as me-te, not the same as Pete!)</i><br>
        I've always been interested in the <b><em>creative side</em></b> of Computer Engineering.<br>
        In this generation where ideas are born <b><em>each and every day</b></em>, it's getting harder to find a new and original one. <br>
        As a student, I plan my route for creating and developing <b><em>new ideas, new designs</em></b> for the software sector.</small>

    <p style="color: white">My favourite quote is<br>
    <i><q>Intelligence is the ability to adapt to <strong>change</strong></q></i> by Stephen Hawking<br><br>
    <small>But was he the one who said that?<br><br>
    Kitty Ferguson, an American science writer who authored the 2010 book <br>
    <cite>Stephen Hawking: An Unfettered Mind</cite> with the scientist's support, wrote in an email:</p></small>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/03/29/stephen-hawking-famously-said-intelligence-is-the-ability-to-adapt-to-change-but-did-he-really-say-it/">
      <q>This sounds like something Stephen might have said, <br>
      but I never heard him say it, nor have I read it in any of his own books.<br>
      I have a very vague memory of seeing this attributed to someone else besides Stephen,<br>
      but I can't remember who that was or where I read it. Could it be Machiavelli?</q></blockquote>
